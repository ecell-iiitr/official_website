          E-Cell IIIT Ranchi is a non-profit student run organization where we
          crave and explore the constantly evolving world of entrepreneurship
          and start-up cult. In our quest to promote the spirit of
          entrepreneurship among the community, we try to answer essential
          questions like “How this realm of entrepreneurship affects us in our
          day-to-day lives?” and the likes of “Can I construct my start-up idea
          into a functional business model?” To spread this very essence, we
          host various seminars/webinars, lectures, podcasts and book summaries,
          innovative games, brainstorming sessions, competitions. Besides that,
          we host the most prominent annual entrepreneurial summit of the
          northeast, “UDGAM”, which includes numerous informative events about
          entrepreneurship.
